# IDSRSAHelper

This package helps to encrypt and decrypt strings by using all the RSA API's provided by the Security Framework.

It also uses [BoringSSL](https://github.com/firebase/boringssl-SwiftPM) to perform some more advanced operations, such as encrypting data using a private key and decrypting it using a public key.
